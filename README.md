# ytdownloader

**ytdownloader** is a command-line tool to download a YouTube video, trim it between specified start and end times, and save it as an MP4 file.

The goal is to simplify the process of extracting specific parts of YouTube videos without needing multiple tools or manual steps. The tool handles downloading, trimming, and format conversion internally.

Currently, it requires Python (>=3.8), yt-dlp, and ffmpeg. Future versions aim to bundle all dependencies into a single executable.
